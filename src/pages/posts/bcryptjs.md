"My database got hacked..."

This is a ubiquitous statement when it comes to database integration. Today, let's explore a powerful method of protection: bcrypt.

# BcryptJS

When it comes to user passwords, security is paramount in today's digital landscape. Bcrypt is a popular hashing function that helps safeguard sensitive information like passwords. It works by converting plain text passwords into scrambled characters (hashes), making them much more secure than storing passwords directly. BcryptJS, a JavaScript library, simplifies using bcrypt üè¶

In our interconnected world, data breaches are costly and damaging to a company‚Äôs reputation. By using bcryptJS, we‚Äôre taking a proactive step towards better security.

# Advantages 

But what makes bcrypt stand out?

Adaptive Hashing: Bcrypt allows you to increase the computational complexity of the hashing process over time. As hardware becomes more powerful, you can adjust the work factor, making it harder for attackers to crack passwords.
